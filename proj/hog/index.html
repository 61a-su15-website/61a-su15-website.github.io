    <h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies
for the dice game Hog. You will need to use <em>control statements</em> and
<em>higher-order functions</em> together, as described in Sections 1.2
through 1.6 of <a href="http://composingprograms.com">Composing Programs</a>.</p>

<p>In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to reach 100 points first.
On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll,
up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice
outcomes, unless any of the dice comes up a 1, in which case the score
for the turn is only 1 point (the <strong>Pig out</strong> rule).</p>

<p>To spice up the game, we will play with some special rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Free bacon</strong>. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores one more
  than the largest digit in the opponent's score.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Example 1</em>: If Player 1 has 42 points, Player 0 gains 1 + max(4, 2) = 5
    points by rolling zero dice.</li>
    <li><em>Example 2</em>: If Player 1 has 48 points, Player 0 gains 1 + max(4, 8) = 9
    points.</li>
    <li><em>Example 3</em>: If Player 1 has 7 points, Player 0 gains 1 + max(0, 7) = 8
    points by rolling zero dice.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Hog wild</strong>. If the sum of both players' total scores is a multiple
  of seven (e.g., 14, 21, 35), then the current player rolls four-sided
  dice instead of the usual six-sided dice.</li>
  <li><strong>Swine Swap</strong>. At the end of each turn, if the last two digits of Player 0's
  score are the reverse of the last two digits of Player 1's score, the players'
  score will be swapped.
  <br/>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Example 1</em>: Player 0 has a score of 19 and Player 1 has a score of
    91 after Player 0 has rolled. Reversing the last two digits of Player 0's
    score (19) results in 91, which are the last two digits of Player 1's score.
    This is considered a swap and the player's scores are switched. Player 0 now
    has a score of 91, Player 1 now has a score of 19 and Player 0's turn is over.</li>
    <li><em>Example 2</em>: Player 0 has a score of 80 and Player 1 has a score of
    8 at the end of Player 1's turn. In this example, Player 1's score is viewed
    as 08, which is the reverse of 80. The player's scores are swapped, leaving,
    Player 0 with 8 and Player 1 with 80.  Player 1's turn ends.</li>
    <li><em>Example 3</em>: Player 0 begins their turn with a score of 90 while Player 1
    has 70 points. Player 0 rolls 7 dice, giving them 17 points. They now
    have a score of 107 and Player 1 has a score of 70. Swapping the last two
    digits of 107 will give back 70, so the two scores are swapped. Player 0
    ends their turn with a score of 70 while Player 1 now has a score of 107.
    Because the swap occurs before Player 0's turn is over, Player 1 wins the
    game.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="download-starter-files">Download starter files</h2>


<p>To get started, download all of the project code as a <a href="hog.zip">zip
archive</a>. You only have to make changes to <code>hog.py</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hog.py</code>: A starter implementation of Hog</li>
  <li><code>dice.py</code>: Functions for rolling dice</li>
  <li><code>hog_gui.py</code>: A graphical user interface for Hog</li>
  <li><code>ucb.py</code>: Utility functions for CS 61A</li>
  <li><code>ok</code>: CS 61A autograder</li>
  <li><code>hog_eval.py</code>: Utility for evaluating the Hog project</li>
  <li><code>tests</code>: A directory of tests used by <code>ok</code></li>
  <li><code>images</code>: A directory of images used by <code>hog_gui.py</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>Logistics</h2>

<p>This is a 1-week project. You may work with one other
partner.  You should not share your code with students who are not your
partner or copy from anyone else's solutions.</p>

<p>In the end, you will submit one project for both partners. The
project is worth 20 points. 18 points are
assigned for correctness, and 2 points for the overall <a
  href="../../articles/composition.html">composition</a> of your program.</p>

<p>You will turn in the following files:</p>


<ul>
  <li><code>hog.py</code></li>
</ul>


<p>You do not need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the
project. To submit the project, run the following command:

<pre><code>python3 ok --submit</code></pre>

<p>You will be able to view your submissions on the <a
  href="http://ok.cs61a.org">OK dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.</p>

<p>However, please do <b>not</b> modify any other functions.  Doing so may
result in your code failing our autograder tests. Also, please do not
change any function signatures (names, argument order, or number of
arguments).</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your
code.  It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate
any problems.</p>

<p>We have provided an <b>autograder</b> called <code>ok</code> to help you with
testing your code and tracking your progress. The first time you run
the autograder, you will be asked to <b>log in with your OK account using your web browser</b>. Please do so. Each time you run
<code>ok</code>, it will back up your work and progress on our
servers.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of <code>ok</code> is to test your implementations, but there
is a catch. At first, the test cases are <i>locked</i>. To unlock tests,
run the following command from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -u</code></pre>

<p>This command will start an interactive prompt that looks like:</p>

<pre>
=====================================================================
Assignment: The Game of Hog
OK, version ...
=====================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlocking tests

At each "? ", type what you would expect the output to be.
Type exit() to quit

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 0 &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1
(cases remaining: 1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Code here
?
</pre>

<p>At the <code>?</code>, you can type what you expect the output to be.
If you are correct, then this test case will be available the next time
you run the autograder.</p>

<p>The idea is to understand <i>conceptually</i> what your program should do
first, before you start writing any code.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked some tests and written some code, you can check
the correctness of your program using the tests that you have
unlocked:</p>

<pre>python3 ok</pre>

<p>Most of the time, you will want to focus on a particular question.
Use the <code>-q</code> option as directed in the problems below.</p>

<p>The <code>tests</code> folder is used to store autograder tests, so make sure
<b>not to modify it</b>. You may lose all your unlocking progress if you
do. If you need to get a fresh copy, you can download the
<a href="hog.zip">zip archive</a> and copy it over, but you
will need to start unlocking from scratch.</p>




<h2 id="graphical-user-interface">Graphical User Interface</h2>


<p>A <strong>graphical user interface</strong> (GUI, for short) is provided for you.
At the moment, it doesn't work because you haven't implemented the
game logic.  Once you complete the <code>play</code> function, you will be able
to play a fully interactive version of Hog!</p>

<p>In order to render the graphics, make sure you have Tkinter, Python's
main graphics library, installed on your computer. Once you've done
that, you can run the GUI from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>Once you complete the project, you can play against the final strategy
that you've created!</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py &#x2d;f</code></pre>


<h2 id="phase-1-simulator">Phase 1: Simulator</h2>


<p>In the first phase, you will develop a simulator for the game of Hog.</p>


<h3 id="problem-0-0-pt">Problem 0 (0 pt)</h3>


<p>The <code>dice.py</code> file represents dice using non-pure zero-argument
functions. These functions are non-pure because they may have
different return values each time they are called. The documentation
of <code>dice.py</code> describes the two different types of dice used in the
project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dice can be fair, meaning that they produce each possible outcome with equal
  probability. Examples: <code>four_sided</code>, <code>six_sided</code>.</li>
  <li>For testing functions that use dice, deterministic test dice always cycle
  through a fixed sequence of values that are passed as arguments to the
  <code>make_test_dice</code> function.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we start writing any code, let's understand the <code>make_test_dice</code>
function by unlocking its tests.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 00 &#x2d;u</code></pre>

<p>This should display a prompt that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>=====================================================================

&gt;&gt;&gt; test_dice()
?</code></pre>

<p>You should type in what you expect the output to be. To do so, you
need to first figure out what <code>test_dice</code> will do, based on the
description above.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can exit the unlocker by typing <code>exit()</code> (without
quotes). <strong>Typing Ctrl-C on Windows to exit out of the unlocker has
been known to cause problems, so avoid doing so.</strong></p>


<h3 id="problem-1-2-pt">Problem 1 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>roll_dice</code> function in <code>hog.py</code>. It takes two arguments: the
number of dice to roll, <code>num_rolls</code>, and a <code>dice</code> function. It returns the
number of points scored by rolling that number of dice <strong>simultaneously</strong>: either
the sum of the outcomes or 1 (pig out).</p>

<p>To obtain a single outcome of a dice roll, call <code>dice()</code>. You must
call the <code>dice</code> function <em>exactly</em> the number of times specified by
the first argument (even if a 1 is rolled) since we are rolling all
dice simultaneously in the game.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the
question:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 01 &#x2d;u</code></pre>

<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check
your correctness with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 01</code></pre>

<p>The <code>roll_dice</code> function has a <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/14-designing-functions.html#default-argument-values">default argument value</a>
for <code>dice</code> that is a random six-sided dice function. The tests use fixed dice.</p>


<h3 id="problem-2-1-pt">Problem 2 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>take_turn</code> function, which returns the number of points
scored for a turn.  You will need to implement the <em>Free bacon</em> rule.
You can assume that <code>opponent_score</code> is less than 100. For a score
less than 10, assume that the first of two digits is 0. Your
implementation should call <code>roll_dice</code>.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the
question:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 02 &#x2d;u</code></pre>

<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check
your correctness with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 02</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-3-1-pt">Problem 3 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>select_dice</code> function, which helps enforce the <em>Hog
wild</em> special rule. This function takes two arguments: the scores for
the current and opposing players. It returns either <code>four_sided</code> or
<code>six_sided</code> dice that will be used during the turn.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the
question:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 03 &#x2d;u</code></pre>

<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check
your correctness with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 03</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-4-1-pt">Problem 4 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>To help you implement the <em>Swine Swap</em> special rule, write a function called <code>is_swap</code> that checks to see if the last two digits of the players' scores are swapped.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the
question:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 04 &#x2d;u</code></pre>

<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check
your correctness with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 04</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-5-3-pt">Problem 5 (3 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>play</code> function, which simulates a full game of
Hog. Players alternate turns, each using their respective strategy function
(Player 0 uses strategy0, etc.), until one of the players reaches the <code>goal</code>
score. When the game ends, <code>play</code> returns the final total scores of both players,
with Player 0's score first, and Player 1's score second.</p>

<p>Here are some hints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remember to enforce all the special rules! You should enforce the
  <em>Hog wild</em> special rule here (by calling <code>select_dice</code>), as well as
  the <em>Swine Swap</em> special rule here.</li>
  <li>You should use the <code>take_turn</code> and <code>is_swap</code> functions that you've already written.</li>
  <li>You can get the number of the other player (either 0 or 1) by calling
  the provided function <code>other</code>.</li>
  <li>A <em>strategy</em> is a function that, given a player's score and their opponent's
  score, returns how many dice the player wants to roll. A strategy
  function (such as <code>strategy0</code> and <code>strategy1</code>) takes two arguments:
  scores for the current player and opposing player. A strategy
  function returns the number of dice that the current player wants to
  roll in the turn. Don't worry about details of implementing
  strategies yet. You will develop them in Phase 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the
question:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 05 &#x2d;u</code></pre>

<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check
your correctness with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 05</code></pre>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: the last test for Question 5 is a <em>fuzz test</em>, which checks your
<code>play</code> function works for any arbitrary inputs. Failing this test means
something is wrong, but you should look at other tests to see where the
problem might be.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once you are finished, you will be able to play a graphical version of
the game. We have provided a file called <code>hog_gui.py</code> that
you can run from the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>If you don't already have Tkinter (Python's graphics library)
installed, you'll need to install it first before you can run the GUI.</p>

<p>The GUI relies on your implementation, so if you have any bugs in your
code, they will be reflected in the GUI. This means you can also use
the GUI as a debugging tool; however, it's better to run the tests
first.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have finished Phase 1 of this project!</p>


<h2 id="phase-2-strategies">Phase 2: Strategies</h2>


<p>In the second phase, you will experiment with ways to improve upon the
basic strategy of always rolling a fixed number of dice. First, you need to
develop some tools to evaluate strategies.</p>


<h3 id="problem-6-2-pt">Problem 6 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>make_averaged</code> function, which is a higher-order function that
takes a function <code>fn</code> as an argument. It returns another function that takes
the same number of arguments as <code>fn</code> (the function originally passed into
<code>make_averaged</code>). This returned function differs from the input function in that
it returns the average value of repeatedly calling <code>fn</code> on the same arguments.
This function should call <code>fn</code> a total of <code>num_samples</code> times and return the
average of the results.</p>

<p>To implement this function, you need a new piece of Python syntax! You
must write a function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments,
then calls another function using exactly those arguments. Here's how
it works.</p>

<p>Instead of listing formal parameters for a function, we write <code>*args</code>.
To call another function using exactly those arguments, we call it
again with <code>*args</code>. For example,</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def printed(fn):
...     def print_and_return(*args):
...         result = fn(*args)
...         print(&#x27;Result:&#x27;, result)
...         return result
...     return print_and_return
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow = printed(pow)
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow(2, 8)
Result: 256
256
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_abs = printed(abs)
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_abs(&#x2d;10)
Result: 10
10</code></pre>

<p>Read the docstring for <code>make_averaged</code> carefully to understand how it
is meant to work.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the
question:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 06 &#x2d;u</code></pre>

<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check
your correctness with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 06</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-7-2-pt">Problem 7 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>max_scoring_num_rolls</code> function, which runs an
experiment to determine the number of rolls (from 1 to 10) that gives
the maximum average score for a turn.  Your implementation should use
<code>make_averaged</code> and <code>roll_dice</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If two numbers of rolls are tied for the maximum average
score, return the lower number. For example, if both 3 and 6 achieve a
maximum average score, return 3.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the
question:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 07 &#x2d;u</code></pre>

<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check
your correctness with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 07</code></pre>

<p>To run this experiment on randomized dice, call <code>run_experiments</code> using
the <code>&#x2d;r</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog.py &#x2d;r</code></pre>

<p><strong>Running experiments</strong> For the remainder of this project,
you can change the implementation of <code>run_experiments</code> as you wish.
By calling <code>average_win_rate</code>, you can evaluate various Hog
strategies. For example, change the first <code>if False:</code> to <code>if
True:</code> in order to evaluate <code>always_roll(8)</code> against the
baseline strategy of <code>always_roll(5)</code>.  You should find that it loses
more often than it wins, giving a win rate below 0.5.</p>

<p>Some of the experiments may take up to a minute to run. You can always reduce
the number of samples in <code>make_averaged</code> to speed up experiments.</p>


<h3 id="problem-8-1-pt">Problem 8 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>A strategy can take advantage of the <em>Free bacon</em> rule by rolling 0
when it is most beneficial to do so.  Implement <code>bacon_strategy</code>, which
returns 0 whenever rolling 0 would give <strong>at least</strong> <code>margin</code> points
and returns <code>num_rolls</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the
question:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 08 &#x2d;u</code></pre>

<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check
your correctness with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 08</code></pre>

<p>Once you have implemented this strategy, change <code>run_experiments</code>
to evaluate your new strategy against the baseline. You should find that it
wins more than half of the time.</p>


<h3 id="problem-9-2-pt">Problem 9 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>A strategy can also take advantage of the <em>Swine Swap</em> rule. The
<code>swap_strategy</code></p>

<ol>
  <li>Rolls 0 if it would cause a beneficial swap.</li>
  <li>Rolls <code>num_rolls</code> if rolling 0 would cause a harmful swap in favor of the
  opponent.</li>
  <li>If rolling 0 does not cause a swapped, then roll 0
  if it would give <strong>at least</strong> <code>margin</code> points and roll <code>num_rolls</code>
  otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Note: if a swap would result in the scores not changing, such as both players
having a score of 55, it is considered to be neutral, and should be handled in
case 3 as if the scores had not been swapped at all)</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the
question:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 09 &#x2d;u</code></pre>

<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check
your correctness with:</p>

<p>Once you have implemented this strategy, update <code>run_experiments</code> to
evaluate your new strategy against the baseline.  You should find that
it performs even better than <code>bacon_strategy</code>, on average.</p>

<p>At this point, run the entire autograder to see if there are any tests
that don't pass.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-10-3-pt">Problem 10 (3 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement <code>final_strategy</code>, which combines these ideas and any other ideas you
have to achieve a win rate of at least 0.58 (for full credit) against the
baseline <code>always_roll(5)</code> strategy.  Partial credit is also given if you are
close. Some ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You only need 100 points to win. If you are near the goal, try not
  to pig out and give your opponent a chance to win.</li>
  <li>If you are in the lead, you might take fewer risks. If you are
  losing, you might take bigger risks to catch up.</li>
  <li>Vary your rolls based on whether you will be rolling four-sided or
  six-sided dice.</li>
  <li>Find a way to leave your opponent with four-sided dice more often.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check your final strategy win rate by running:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog.py &#x2d;&#x2d;final</code></pre>

<p>As usual, you can also run OK to check if your win rate is high enough:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 10</code></pre>

<p>You can also play against your final strategy with the graphical user
interface:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py &#x2d;f</code></pre>

<p>The GUI will alternate which player is controlled by you.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you have reached the end of your first CS 61A project!</p>
