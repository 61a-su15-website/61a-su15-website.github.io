    </div>

     <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>


<p>The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with
particular emphasis on software and machines from a programmer's
point of view.</p>

<ol>
  <li>CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the
  programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than
  in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.</li>
  <li>CS 61B will deal with the more advanced engineering aspects of
  software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs.</li>
  <li>CS 61C concentrates on machines and how they carry out the programs
  you write.</li>
</ol>

<p>In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not
about how to use one particular programming language. We consider a
series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as
functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented
programming.</p>

<p>61A primarily uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python 3 programming language</a>.  Python is a
popular language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly
well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in this course.
We will also examine the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29">Scheme</a> programming language in the second
half of the course.</p>

<p>Mastery of a particular programming language is a useful side effect of
61A. However, our hope is that once you have learned the essence of
programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language
is but a few days' work.</p>


<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>


<p>Math 1A is a corequisite for 61A. (That is, it may be taken concurrently.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Programming experience is not a prerequisite for 61A. Many 61A students
have had significant prior programming experience, but many do not.
However, students without prior experience typically spend a large
amount of time each week on the course.</p></blockquote>


<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>


<p>If you don't feel ready for 61A, we recommend <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/">CS 10: The
Beauty and Joy of Computing</a>, which is an introduction to
computer science for non-majors (and majors needing more programming
experience). The course will teach students how to program using Snap
(based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever
invented.</p>

<p>There is also a self-paced version of this course, <a href="http://berkeley-cs61as.github.io/">CS 61AS</a>, which
fulfills the same requirements. CS 61AS will be offered this summer.</p>


<h2 id="course-format">Course Format</h2>


<p>You can find the class calendar at <a href="/">cs61a.org</a>.
All lectures, handouts, and assignments will be posted there.</p>

<p><strong>Lectures</strong>: There are four lectures per week, 90 minutes each. Lecture
slides and recommended readings will be posted the night before each
lecture.</p>

<p><strong>Lab and Discussion Sections</strong>: The course includes two laboratory
sections and two discussion section each week.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you wish to switch sections, simply start attending the section
you wish to join. You do not need to update your section on Bear
Facts. Seating priority will be given to people who are officially
enrolled in a section, but we will all do our best to accommodate
your wishes.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Office Hours</strong>: Office hours are held by all staff members each week.
You can find the office hours schedule
<a href="/weekly.html">here</a>.</p>


<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>


<p>Your course grade is computed using a point system with a total of 300
points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Midterm 1, worth 50 points (16.66%).</li>
  <li>Midterm 2, worth 50 points (16.66%).</li>
  <li>Final exam, worth 80 points (26.66%).</li>
  <li>Four projects, worth a total of 90 points (30%).</li>
  <li>Homework, worth a total of 30 points (10%).</li>
</ul>

<p>Each letter grade for the course corresponds to a range of scores:</p>

<pre><code>A+  293+        A  280&#x2d;292     A&#x2d;  270&#x2d;279
B+  255&#x2d;269     B  232&#x2d;254     B&#x2d;  220&#x2d;231
C+  212&#x2d;219     C  202&#x2d;211     C&#x2d;  190&#x2d;201
D+  180&#x2d;189     D  170&#x2d;179     D&#x2d;  160&#x2d;169</code></pre>

<p>Notice that this scale is nonlinear; the steps are wider in the B range.</p>

<blockquote><p>This grading formula implies that <em>there is no curve</em>; your grade will
depend only on how well you do, and not on how well everyone else does.</p></blockquote>


<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>


<ul>
  <li>Midterm 1: Thursday, 7/9 from 6 - 8 PM in 2050 VLSB</li>
  <li>Midterm 2: Thursday, 7/30 from 6 - 8 PM in 155 Dwinelle</li>
  <li>Final: Thursday, 8/13 from 3 - 6 PM in 2050 VLSB</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>If you have a conflict with an exam, you will fill out a survey near
the time of the exam to let us know, and we will offer an alternate
exam time.</p></blockquote>


<h3 id="midterm-recovery-points">Midterm recovery points</h3>


<p>We understand that exams may not be entirely indicative of your efforts
in the class. For this reason, you may earn back a certain number of
points for each exam based on your lab submissions.</p>

<p>Each midterm has 6 labs associated with it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Midterm 1: labs 1 - 6</li>
  <li>Midterm 2: labs 7 - 12</li>
</ul>

<p>We compute your recovery points with the following formula:</p>

<pre><code>def recovery_points(score, labs):
    return max(score, score / 2 + labs * 2) &#x2d; score</code></pre>

<p>This means if you score 24 or higher, your score remains the same. If you score
below 24, you have the chance to recover a few points. The more labs you submit,
the more points you can earn back.</p>

<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>



<h3 id="labs">Labs</h3>


<p>Labs are exercises designed to introduce a new topic. You can complete
and submit these during the scheduled lab sections.</p>

<p>Labs are not worth any points. To encourage you to do the labs, we will
use lab submissions to calculate <a href="#midterm-recovery-points">midterm recovery
points</a>.</p>


<h3 id="diagnostics">Diagnostics</h3>


<p>Each Friday, we will release a diagnostic to help you gauge your
understanding of that week's material. Diagnostics are purely for your
benefit; they are not submitted, and are not used to calculate grades
in any way.</p>


<h3 id="homework-assignments">Homework assignments</h3>


<p>There are 12 homework assignments, worth 3 points each. We will drop
your 2 lowest homework grades, for a total of 10 x 3 = 30 points.</p>

<p>You are welcome to discuss homeworks with your classmates, as long as you write
your own code and submit your own work.</p>


<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>


<p>There are 4 projects during the semester, for a total of 90 points.
Projects are larger assignments intended to combine ideas from the
course in interesting ways. The four programming projects are graded
on the correctness as well as for code composition (i.e. code clarity
and legibility).</p>

<p>You are welcome to complete projects in pairs; your partner can be
anyone else enrolled in 61A. You may also work alone.</p>


<h3 id="late-policy">Late policy</h3>


<p>If you cannot turn in an assignment on time, contact your TA and
partner as early as possible; depending on the circumstance, we may
grant extensions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Labs</strong>: for midterm recovery policy purposes, we will not accept any
  late submissions of labs.</li>
  <li><strong>Homework assignments</strong>: we will not accept any late submissions of
  homework. You are allowed to drop 2 homework assignments.</li>
  <li><strong>Projects</strong>: Submissions that are within 24 hours after the deadline
  will only receive 2/3 of the earned score. Submissions that are 24
  hours or more after the deadline will receive 0 points.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="learning-cooperatively">Learning cooperatively</h2>


<p>With the obvious exception of exams, we encourage you to
discuss course activities with your friends and classmates as you are
working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you
work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions,
and share ideas liberally.</p>

<blockquote><p>Since you're working collaboratively, keep your project partner and
TA informed. If some medical or personal emergency takes you away
from the course for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the
course for any reason, please don't just disappear silently!  You
should inform your project partner, so that nobody is depending on
you to do something you can't finish.</p></blockquote>


<h3 id="piazza-online-forum">Piazza: online forum</h3>


<p>If you have questions that others might have as well, regarding
projects, homeworks, course policies, etc., post your questions to
<a href="http://www.piazza.com/class">Piazza</a>, the course discussion forum. Piazza allows you to answer
questions from other students.</p>

<p>You are welcome to email your instructor or TA directly, but please try
Piazza first! Contact information appears on the staff page of the
course website.</p>


<h3 id="cheating-policy">Cheating policy</h3>


<p>Cooperation has a limit, however, and in 61A that limit is sharing
code. Feel free to discuss the problems with others beforehand, but you
must write your own solutions.  The only student with which you can
share code is your homework and project partner.</p>

<p>Since this may be your first computer science class, exactly what
constitutes as cheating might be unclear. The following is a list of
things you should NOT do. This list is not
exhaustive, but covers most of the big offenses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not copy code from any student who is not your partner.</li>
  <li>Do not allow any student other than your partner to copy code from
  you.</li>
  <li>Do not post your solutions online publicly. This includes Pastebin
  and public repositories on Github (you are welcome to use private
  repositories)</li>
  <li>Do not copy solutions from online. This includes solutions found on
  public Github repositories.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find a solution online, please
<a href="http://goo.gl/GEHk49">submit a link to that solution</a>.</p>

<p>We expect you to hand in your own work, take your own tests, and
complete your own projects.  The assignments and evaluations are
structured to help you learn, which is why you're here. The course
staff works hard to put together this course, and we ask in return that
you respect the integrity of the course by not misrepresenting your
work.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Policies/acad.dis.shtml">EECS Department Policy on Academic
Dishonesty</a> says,
"Copying all or part of another person's work, or using reference
materials not specifically allowed, are forms of cheating and will not
be tolerated." The policy statement goes on to explain the penalties
for cheating, which range from a zero grade for the test up to
dismissal from the University, for a second offense.</p>

<p>For this class, the policy will be that you receive a score of -50% of the
assignment score. For example, if an assignment is worth 10 points, you will
receive a -5 out of 10.</p>

<p>Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help.  You are not
alone in this course!  The entire staff is here to help you succeed.
If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects,
you won't need to copy any answers.</p>


<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>



<h3 id="tutoring">Tutoring</h3>


<p>Starting the second week of class, we will have tutoring sessions every week.
All tutoring-related announcements, scheduling, and handouts will be posted on
the <a href="../tutoring.html">tutoring page</a></p>

<p>At tutoring, we will review class material from the previous week in a small
group setting (around 6 students per session), so that you have the opportunity
to get more personalized help.</p>

<p>Because of we have a limited number of tutors, we will only be able to
accommodate around half the students in the class every week. Every week, we
will have sign-ups on the <a href="../tutoring.html">tutoring page</a>.</p>


<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>


<p>The online textbook for the course is <a href="http://composingprograms.com">Composing Programs</a>, which was
created specifically for this course. Readings for each lecture appear in the
course schedule.</p>

<p>We will occasionally differ from the material found in Composing
Programs. As a result, we recommend the lecture notes, labs, and
discussion handouts as your primary source of information.</p>


<h3 id="computer-resources">Computer Resources</h3>


<p>The computing laboratories in 271, 273, 275, and 277 Soda are our primary lab
rooms, although the CS 61A accounts can also be used from any EECS
Instructional lab in Soda or Cory Hall.  The lab is normally available for use
at all times, but you need a card key for evening access to the lab.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Current UCB students:</strong> If you are enrolled in the course, your Cal
  student ID serves as your card key and will automatically be
  activated for access to the Soda second floor labs (including
  entering the building). You do not have to do anything, unless for
  some reason it doesn't work, then see below.</li>
  <li><strong>Concurrent/other students:</strong> You can fill out an application and
  obtain a white card key from 387 Soda Hall (the front desk). There is
  a small fee for access.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be respectful of the lab space. Please don't steal the chairs, and definitely
<strong>do not eat or drink in the lab</strong>. Don't unplug anything; unplugged
computers make our hard-working instructional computing team very sad.
If you see someone disrupting the space, ask them to stop.</p>


<h2 id="a-parting-thought">A Parting Thought</h2>


<p>Grades and penalties aren't the purpose of the course. We actually just
want you to learn.  We're very excited to have such a large and
enthusiastic group of students this semester.  We want all of you to be
successful here.  Welcome to 61A!</p>
