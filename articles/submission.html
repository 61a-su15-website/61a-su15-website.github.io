     <h2 id="submitting-assignments">Submitting Assignments</h2>


<p>Here is a simple guide that will help you submit all your assignments
for CS61A. Don't worry: it's easy!</p>


<h3 id="the-basics">The Basics</h3>


<p>Before we begin to submit an assignment, we need to check for a few
things:</p>

<p>We are logged into our CS61A account (i.e. cs61a-bh).  We have the
files we need to submit in our account.  We know what assignment we are
supposed to submit.  To submit assignments for this class, we will use
a simple command line program called &mdash; wait for it &mdash; <code>submit</code>. To
start submitting an assignment, type submit, followed by the name of
the assignment. When we are at the prompt, we should see something like
this:</p>

<pre><code>cory [16] ~/hw1 # submit hw1</code></pre>

<p>This means that we are currently in our Homework 1 directory, indicated
by <code>~/hw1</code>, and that we are submitting the assignment hw1, the first
homework assignment.</p>

<p>Tap return and you should then see that the sumbit program
automatically searches for the files it wants in the current directory.</p>

<pre><code>Looking for files to turn in....
Submitting hw1.py.</code></pre>

<p>If there are other files (apart from the required files) in the current
directory, the sumbit program will also ask to check those files. Once
finished selecting the right files, you'll see:</p>

<pre><code>Is this correct? [yes/no]</code></pre>

<p>If any of the information above is incorrect, you have a chance to
cancel your submission here (type <code>no</code> or <code>n</code>). However, don't worry
too much because you can submit as many times as you want before the
deadline. If it is correct, type <code>yes</code> or <code>y</code>. To finish up, the system
should output:</p>

<pre><code>Submission complete.</code></pre>


<h3 id="few-simple-rules">Few Simple Rules</h3>


<p>Here are some simple rules that you need to know to make sure all of
your assignments get submitted properly.</p>


<h4 id="names">Names</h4>


<p><code>submit</code> only accepts certain names for assignments, but they are easy
to remember:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>hw#</code>, for each homework assignment.</li>
  <li><code>proj#</code>, for each project.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you type in an incorrect name, <code>submit</code> will kindly remind you of
all possible assignments.</p>


<h4 id="files">Files</h4>


<p><code>submit</code> is only trained to look for certain files depending upon the
assignment. In CS61A, we will provide you all of the files you will
need to submit for each homework assignment and project. If you try to
change the name of the file that submit is expecting (or the file isn't
there), <code>submit</code> will let you know what files need to be present for
the submission to be successful.</p>

<pre><code>Looking for files to turn in....
Turn in ./interesting_file.something?  [yes/no] yes
You must turn in a file hw1.py for this assignment.
Here is the complete list of files you must turn in:
  hw1.py
Error: submission FAILED.</code></pre>

<p>If you have subdirectories (that is, a directory within a directory),
then <code>submit</code> will ask you whether or not you would like it to check
those.</p>

<pre><code>cory [32] ~/hw1 # submit hw1
Looking for files to turn in....
Look at files in directory ./Another_Dir? [yes/no] yes
Look at files in directory ./Another_Dir/And_Another? [yes/no] yes
Look at files in directory ./Another_Dir/And_Another/WHEN_WILL_IT_END? [yes/no] yes
Look at files in directory ./Another_Dir/And_Another/WHEN_WILL_IT_END/NOW? [yes/no] no
Skipping directory ./Another_Dir/And_Another/WHEN_WILL_IT_END/NOW.
Turn in ./interesting_file.something?  [yes/no] yes
Submitting hw1.py.
The files you have submitted are:
        ./hw1.py ./interesting_file.something
Is this correct? [yes/no] yes
Copying submission of assignment hw1....
Submission complete.</code></pre>


<h3 id="some-tips">Some Tips</h3>


<p>These will help you make the most effective use of <code>submit</code>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remember that you tell submit the name of the assignment you are
  submitting, not the current directory.</li>
  <li>Whenever <code>submit</code> asks for <code>[yes/no]</code>, typing in <code>y</code> is equivalent
  to typing in <code>yes</code> (and similarly, <code>n</code> for <code>no</code>).</li>
  <li>While you may submit from your home directory (<code>~/</code>), it is often
  best to create a separate folder for each assignment. This is to
  avoid having <code>submit</code> ask you if you would like to submit every,
  single, file in your current directory (including all hidden files
  used by UNIX for its own purposes). Keeping your assignments
  organized by making separate directories for each assignment will
  make your life easier (i.e. <code>proj1/</code>, <code>hw1/</code>, etc.).</li>
  <li>If you want to cancel a submission while submit is running, issue
  the abort command with the key combination <code>Ctrl&#x2d;C</code>.</li>
  <li>Finally, our submission system allows for repeated submits. We will
  always grade your <strong>last</strong> submission. Just make sure your last
  submission is done before the assignment deadline!</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, <code>submit</code> is a UNIX program, so if you need any help don't
forget to check out Lab 0 and information on connecting to your CS61A
account. You can also get a brief description of <code>submit</code> using the
command <code>submit &#x2d;h</code>.</p>

<p>If you have any other questions about <code>submit</code> or anything else CS61A
related, don't forget to ask your friendly neighborhood staff or post
on Piazza. â˜º</p>
